# ML Blog

This is a blog about ML, Statistics, and other related topics. I will be posting related to these fields at the time I read about them.

This next application allows you to create a blog with multiple pages and posts.

You only have to create your markdown files and upload them under /blog/<yourpage> and the application will generate the tree in /blog.

In the future, I will be adding more features to this application, like an admin panel to create and edit posts and pages.
