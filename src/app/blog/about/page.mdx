### Who am I?

My name is Lautaro, I am a software engineer with a passion for machine learning and statistics. I have been working in the software industry
for about 2 years now and I have been studying statistics and machine learning for about 1 year.

I'm a graduated systems engineer but I'm also consider myself a kind of self-taught person.
